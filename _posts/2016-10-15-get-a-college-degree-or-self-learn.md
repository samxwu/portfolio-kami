Tech leaders around the country have been making its rounds into the billionaire club without a formal college degree. Think Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, and Mark Zuckerberg, some of the biggest names in the tech industry who dropped out of college. Does this mean you don’t necessarily need a college degree to thrive in tech? 

In almost all cases, there is a general consensus that you can never stop learning in web design and development. Traditional four year university programs tend to move much slower than self-learning. For example, you might have to take prerequisites before you even begin learning the real deal. It’s not uncommon to find that by the time you graduate, some of the technologies you learned in class are outdated given how rapid the tech world moves.

You may find yourself having to complete a combination of computer-related topics along with prerequisites and unrelated core classes to graduate in at a university. When you self-study, you’re in charge of creating your own syllabus, and what you think is important in the future. The internet provides tons of learning opportunities that are free of charge or at a fraction of what you would pay for a formal education. A lot of languages such as MySQL, PHP, MongDB, etc., can be self-taught without a teacher. You’re basically in charge of what you want to learn at the time you desire, and at your own budget.

So what are some benefits of a formal four year program? For one, universities provide you with a host of other skillsets that’s hard to quantify: social skills, the ability to multitask, prioritizing, ability to self-learn, and basically molding you into a more well-rounded person of yourself. Another great reason is some of us don’t have the motivation, or shall I say discipline, to learn on our own. Teaching ourselves concepts that’s hard to wrap our head around can be extremely challenging. If you’re at a university, your path to learning has been carefully carved out for you. For example, you might take a series of prerequisites, introductory classes, immediate classes, and then finally advanced classes. Because you’re learning all this over an extended period of time over a steady trajectory, you’re probably more likely to retain the information better and have a more formal understanding compare to self-learning.

So should you self-learn or jump into a four year program? For some, the answer could be programming boot camps, an accelerated program that combines the best of both worlds. Like universities, these programs start you off by teaching you basic programming concepts and progresses to more advanced topics. It only focuses on coursework that is relevant to web development, reducing learning time significantly compared to four year programs. By enrolling in an accelerated program, you’re essentially disciplining yourself to learn the trade so the odds of success is much higher. Some even go as far as guaranteeing job placement or your money back upon completing the program. The perks of enrolling in these accelerated programs are there. They could be the answer to churning out new tech talents, bridging the gap between traditional universities and self-learning.
