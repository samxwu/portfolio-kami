Learning to program and seeing your code come to realization at the end of the day is fun, but the process of writing a good program can quickly prove to be a daunting task. A good chunk of our time is spent on deconstructing the code we wrote, or figuring out how to get things to work. By instilling good development practices, we can make that process less painful. Here are 5 habits that is worth investing in to write cleaner and more manageable code.  


**1. Write Friendly And Organized Code**

Keep in mind that the code you write is not a one time deal. You’re writing code for your future self and for others as well, so don’t write code that leaves people scratching their heads. Keep your naming consistent: if you name private variables with an underscore as the first letter, do it all the way. Variable and method names should describe what your variable and or method does exactly. If you can’t figure out what a variable or method does at first glance, chances are you won’t figure it the second or third time. Don’t forget to use proper indentation and line breaks. Not only is it visually pleasing, you can also more easily reveal your general code structure. 

Bringing organization to your code structure helps with readability, allows for easier modifications, and saves you a few migraines. While it may seem convenient to have all your code in a single file, it can quickly turn into a debugging nightmare. Each file should be separated according to its primary functions with the appropriate language. Think of it as an office with multiple departments. The Accounting department should only be in charge of the company’s general ledger and do all its bookkeeping in accounting specific lingo. Likewise, the IT department should only be in charge of tech related aspects. This organization structure makes it much easier to understand how your code works and to pinpoint issues.


**2. Have A Plan Prior To Coding**

Know exactly what your goals are and how you intend to get there before you start any form of coding. Having a plan prior to coding will not only give you a sense of direction, it will help you stay on track and minimize retries. Instead of programming in parallel, it makes more sense to figure out the procedure first, and then write a solution. Doing this allows you to visualize how to piece parts together, come up with the best actionable plan, and recognize underlying issues early on. 

Planning also helps you figure out the maintenance cost for your code. Will your code require you to manually change hundreds of variables individually, line by line when you need to change parameters? Is your data management system optimized? Is your code independent from each other such that when changes are applied or new features are added, it will not break down your entire system? These are some thoughts to consider when planning.


**3. Learn To Debug Smarter**

The odds of writing bug-free code is zero to none, so it’s imperative to learn to debug efficiently. Traditional trial-and-error methods may work, but painstakingly slow. Thankfully there are debugging tools readily available to make your debugging process a bit more pleasant. Take Google’s Developer tool for example. It comes with error detection, breakpoint setting, and allows you to inspect elements with ease. Investing the time to learn these tools inside out will make your coding experience that much more pleasant.


**4. Use Version Control**

There will be times when you make a huge programming mistake. Your mistake may involve multiple files with modifications spanning weeks ago, and you suddenly wish you can magically turn back time. With version control softwares, like Git, you can do just that. Git allows you to keep unlimited revisions, branch out the file for experimental purposes, track specific changes, revert back to earlier versions, or even find out who is to “blame” for certain errors in group projects. Git does require some time to learn, but there are plenty of tutorials and guides to help you get a good handle on it. Version control is used ubiquitously so it’s better to learn it sooner than later.


**5. Don’t Stop Learning**

With new programming languages and developmental approaches coming onto the market faster than you can read this blog post, you can get phased out fairly quickly in this industry. Many languages that were once glorified during the pinnacle of its times are now obsolete. The only way to stay relevant is to keep learning. Keep programming. Keep challenging yourself. That goes without saying regardless of the field you’re in, but rings especially true in the tech world.
