You’re coding away on a new project you’ve been given. Everything's coming together nicely. Your code seems to be working as expected. You preview your web page and whip out your trusty Developer tool. No errors so far, you’re in the clear. 

Feeling optimistic, you begin to dabble around with your new creation and notice one of its functionalities is out of whack. You pinpoint where the problem is coming from and begin to hatch a brilliant solution that will make everything brilliant again. You implement this brilliant solution of yours and quickly hit refresh. You jump to where the problem was with a new sense of enthusiasm. And then...nothing. Nothing happens. You take two, and nothing happens. Third time's a charm, nada. Not even a twitch. 

This is the point where you start asking yourself “Do I spend more time figuring out what’s really going on and resolve the issue once and for all, or do I go on a quest to the wild wild west of Stackoverflow to find something that I can tinker around with to get it to work and move on?” I am sure many others who write CSS and JavaScript can relate to this or have similar experiences. This is one of the dilemmas I often find myself in when learning to develop. While I want to spend the time to fully understand conceptually why a particular solution works, I am subconsciously already thinking about deadlines. The stakes become even higher when there are multiple stakeholders on the project waiting on you. 

Within this context, it seems all too tempting to just find something that works, and then just move on. I get that sometimes you need a fix now when spending the time to figure out why your hack works now seems all too cost intensive. However, it pays off in the long run. If you never take the time to wade through the root of your problem, it’s likely that you will revisit the same situation many times over in the future. Investing time to become well versed in your work will save you time in the future. Having a fuller understanding in the systems that you work with translates to less guessing, more solid planning, and reducing time consuming errors. Besides, do you really want your answer to be along the lines of “I don’t know why, but if I remove it, it breaks down”, when asked “Why did you add `float: left` there?”

While figuring things out on your own helps to develop deeper understanding, I don’t want to discount the importance of learning from other people’s code. Reading other’s code exposes you to new approaches, broadening your scope along the way. Being able to comprehend code you didn’t author is crucial to working on a team or contributing to open source projects.

There’s obvious advantages and disadvantages to figuring things out on your own versus taking someone else’s code. The key takeaway here is, regardless of the approach you use to resolve the issue, quitting learning isn’t a viable option.
